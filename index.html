                <h2>What is Vaccination?</h2>
                <p>Vaccination is a biological preparation containing a partially killed form of a pathogen, such as a
                    virus or bacteria.
                    This toxin has been injected into the body for the immune system to remember the pathogen, allowing
                    the immune system to
                    work rapidly when it comes across the actual pathogen.</p>

                <h2>Variolation</h2>
                <p>Variolation is the process of exposing healthy individuals to smallpox scabs and cowpox scabs to
                    provide immunity to
                    smallpox. However, 1-3% of individuals died in the process. This type of variolation was famous in
                    Asian countries from
                    the early 1400s to the late 1700s.</p>

                <h2>First Vaccination</h2>
                <p>In the year 1796, the first smallpox vaccination was created by the British physician Edward Jenner.
                    He observed that
                    milkmaids who had been in contact with cowpox were immune to smallpox. Thus, on May 14, 1796, he
                    performed a smallpox
                    vaccination experiment on James Phipps, using cowpox pus from the lesions on the hands of Sarah
                    Nelmes, a milkmaid.</p>

                <h2>First rabies vaccine</h2>
                <p>Louis Pasteur and his colleagues injected the first of 14 daily doses of rabbit spinal cord
                    suspensions containing
                    progressively inactivated rabies virus into 9-year-old Joseph Meister, who had been severely bitten
                    by a rabid dog 2
                    days before. From this, the foundation for understanding vaccination begins, as it demonstrates the
                    principles of
                    vaccination.</p>

                <h2>Development of Vaccines</h2>
                <p>Over time, the development of vaccination has been very successful with the introduction of new
                    vaccines, such as
                    diphtheria, BCG vaccine, hepatitis B, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), polio, yellow fever,
                    tetanus toxoid, HPV
                    vaccine, malaria, Ebola, and the most recent COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, recent technological
                    advancements play a
                    crucial role in the rapid development cycle of vaccinations.

                <h2>Elimination Efforts</h2>
                <p>The success of vaccination has greatly contributed to the public health sector by achieving control
                    over deadly diseases
                    such as COVID-19 and Ebola. One of the greatest feats of vaccination is the eradication of smallpox.
                    In 1949, the last
                    natural outbreak of smallpox occurred, and subsequently, in 1980, the World Health Assembly declared
                    smallpox to be
                    eliminated.
