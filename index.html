            <h2>What is Vaccination?</h2>
            <p>Vaccination is a biological preparation containing a partially killed form of a pathogen, such as a virus or bacteria.
            This toxin has been injected into the body for the immune system to remember the pathogen, allowing the immune system to
            work rapidly when it comes across the actual pathogen.</p>

            <h2>Variolation</h2>
            <p>Variolation is the process of exposing healthy individuals to smallpox scabs and cowpox scabs to provide immunity to
            smallpox. However, 1-3% of individuals died in the process. This type of variolation was famous in Asian countries from
            the early 1400s to the late 1700s.</p>

            <h2>First Vaccination</h2>
            <p>In the year 1796, the first smallpox vaccination was created by the British physician <strong>Edward Jenner</strong>. He observed that
            milkmaids who had been in contact with cowpox were immune to smallpox. Thus, on May 14, 1796, he performed a smallpox
            vaccination experiment on James Phipps, using cowpox pus from the lesions on the hands of Sarah Nelmes, a milkmaid.</p>

            <h2>First rabies vaccine</h2>
            <p><strong>Louis Pasteur</strong> and his colleagues injected the first of 14 daily doses of rabbit spinal cord
                suspensions containing
                progressively inactivated rabies virus into 9-year-old Joseph Meister, who had been severely bitten by a rabid dog 2
                days before. From this, the foundation for understanding vaccination begins, as it demonstrates the principles of
                vaccination.</p>
